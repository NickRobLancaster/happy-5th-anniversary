              We've made it to the 5 year hump! I'm so happy that we've been
              able to make it this far. According to what statistics say, we are
              much more likely to live out a lifelong marriage once a married
              couple has hit this milestone. I'm so greatful to God for bringing
              us together and for keeping us together (I know we've had a lot of
              things we've felt at times but God has been faithful to his
              promise).

                    So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God
                    has joined together, let no one separate.‚Äù

              I know I have my issues but you continue to love me anyway.
              There's a lot that I'm not worthy of but you continue to show me
              underserved grace in so many areas of our marriage. I'm so
              grateful for you and happy that you're my wife. I love you so much
              and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. We still
              have so many years to come!

            <p class="hand-font p-5 text-3xl">
              I thank God for you all the time. If it wasn't for you I wouldn't
              be who I am today (Not that I'm anything significant but you have
              made me a better man in so many ways).
            </p>

            <p class="hand-font p-5 text-3xl">
              I have so much joy in my heart when I practice gratitude for you
              and our marriage and now with our little baby boy, I'm more filled
              with love than I have ever been.

              Since he's been born my focus on working harder has improved and
              i've also become more efficient where work is concerned. Things
              don't seem so hard when I'm doing them for Him and you (I guess
              that's one of the ways God uses our children to change us for the
              better).
            </p>

            <p class="hand-font p-5 text-3xl">
              Let us always remain greatful for one another, continue to pray
              for and with one another as best we can while also granting the
              grace that each other needs (I know I need a lot of it now)
